# Reggie
A Swift domain-specific language (DSL) for crafting Regular Expressions - WORK IN PROGRESS

This is *not* ready for showtime and reuse quite yet.

## To-do
---
[ ] Add a LICENSE
[ ] Make it Swift Package Manager compatible
[ ] Add *unit tests*
[ ] Add methods to run regular expressions in the DSL itself
[ ] Maybe don't make `RegularExpressionRepresentable` use lambdas for no reason
[ ] Documentation
[ ] Remove the main.swift file which was for homework
